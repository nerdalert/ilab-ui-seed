# InstructLab UI Technical Overview

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) framework with [Patternfly](https://www.patternfly.org/get-started/develop/) UI library components.

## Quickstart

- Run the [compose.ui](compose.ui).

## Manually Running the React UI

Set the .env in the ui directory and run the following:

```bash
cd ui/
npm install
npm run dev
# or for prod
npm run build
npm run start
```

## OAuth COnfiguration

You can either set up the Oauth app in your
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
account or use the user/pass defined in `.env`. To change those defaults, create
the `/ui/.env` file and fill in the account user/pass with the following.

Example [.env](.env.example) file.

```text
IL_UI_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
IL_UI_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
IL_UI_API_SERVER_USERNAME=
IL_UI_API_SERVER_PASSWORD=
IL_UI_API_SERVER_URL=http://<IP>:<PORT>
IL_UI_API_CHAT_URL=http:///<IP>:<PORT>
GITHUB_ID=
GITHUB_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<super_secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://<SERVER_ADDRESS>:<PORT>
```

## Development Scripts

```bash
# Install development/build dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Run a production build (outputs to ".next" dir)
npm run build

# Start the Next.js server (run a production build)
npm run start

# Lint the project
npm run lint

# Automatically fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code using Prettier
npm run pretty

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

### Summary of Server-Side Rendering and Client-Side Data Handling for Jobs and Chat Routes

We are leveraging Next.js's app router to handle
[server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering)
(SSR) and client-side data interactions for both jobs and chat functionalities.
Below is a summary of how we manage server-side rendering and client-side data
handling for these routes.

#### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

**API Routes**:

- We have dedicated API routes for both jobs and chat functionalities that
  handle data fetching from the backend. These routes ensure that the data is
  sourced from the server.
- The API routes use environment variables to authenticate and interact with the
  backend services securely.

**Server Components**:

- Components within the `app` directory are treated as server components by
  default. These components handle the initial rendering on the server side.
- For pages like jobs and chat, the main page components are designed to be
  server components, ensuring that the initial data rendering is performed on
  the server.

#### Client-Side Data Handling

**Client Components**:

- Components that utilize client-side hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`,
  etc.) are explicitly marked with `'use client'` to indicate they should be
  executed on the client side.
- These components are responsible for interacting with the API routes to fetch
  and update data dynamically after the initial server-side rendering.

**Custom Hooks**:

- Custom hooks, such as `useFetchJobs` and `usePostChat`, encapsulate the logic
  for API interactions. These hooks handle the state management and side effects
  associated with fetching or posting data.
- By using these hooks, we maintain a clean separation of concerns, keeping the
  components focused on rendering and user interaction.

#### Jobs Functionality

- **API Route**: The jobs API route fetches job data from the backend and
  provides it to the front-end components.
- **Server Component**: The jobs page component fetches the job data server-side
  during the initial render.
- **Client Component**: The jobs list component, marked as a client component,
  uses the `useFetchJobs` hook to handle dynamic data fetching and updating in
  real-time.

#### Chat Functionality

- **API Route**: The chat API route handles posting chat messages to the backend
  and retrieving responses.
- **Server Component**: The chat page component sets up the overall layout and
  structure, rendered server-side initially.
- **Client Component**: The chat form component, marked as a client component,
  uses the `usePostChat` hook to handle user interactions, sending messages to
  the API, and displaying responses dynamically.

### Key Points

- **Separation of Concerns**: By distinguishing between server and client
  components, we ensure that server-side rendering is leveraged for the initial
  load, while client-side components manage dynamic data interactions.
- **API Integration**: The use of API routes ensures secure and efficient
  communication between the front-end and back-end services.
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulating data fetching and state management logic in
  custom hooks promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- **Explicit Client Components**: Marking components with `'use client'` where
  necessary clarifies their role and ensures correct execution context, avoiding
  common pitfalls in SSR and CSR (client-side rendering) integration.

This setup ensures that our application benefits from the performance advantages
of server-side rendering, while still providing a responsive and dynamic user
experience through client-side interactions.

1. **API Route**: The API route fetches job data from the backend and provides it
   to the client. This is already handled correctly with server-side logic.

2. **Hook for Fetching Jobs**: The `useFetchJobs` hook fetches data from the API.
   This is used within a client component since it utilizes React hooks like
   `useState` and `useEffect`.

3. **Jobs Component**: The `AllJobs` component fetches job data using the
   `useFetchJobs` hook. This component is a client component.

4. **Jobs Page Component**: The `AllJobsPage` component renders the `AllJobs`
   component within the `AppLayout`. This component is a server component to
   leverage SSR.
